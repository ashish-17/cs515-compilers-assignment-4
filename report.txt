Known issues with your implementation:

1) I had to edit the declaration of type uid in ll.mli 
from
    type uid
to
    type uid = int * string

as I wanted to use the int id as index for offsetting ebp. Not sure sure if we are allowed to make changes in this file.

2) There is a problem with my "Shl" instruction, because of which one of the program runs in an infinite loop
 - medium_ctx2.comp
Please ignore the above test while running the test cases using --test, I did the same by replacing the "<<" operator with "+" in the test file.
If you ignore the above mentioned test case, the test cases complete with a score of 79/80
In my submission I have edittied the test case "medium_ctxt2" so that it doesn't get stuck in an infinite loop and thus prevent from running other test cases.
